# HaskellKara

[Kara, the programmable ladybug](http://www.swisseduc.ch/informatik/karatojava/) was one of the first exposures
I had to programming, so with this I am trying to create a Haskell version of it.

Since Kara is unfortunately not open source and also written in Java, this will be a complete recreation of it.
